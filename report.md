# Result Summary for Final Project
Results from this project are produced by the pipeline documented in the [readme markdown](readme.md).

## task 5

### documentation

As always, comment your code and document its usage outside the code.
But since this step make take a while to run,
you should also document the time it takes. You must be able to predict
the running time for your full 30 blocks
shortly after you start the computations,

For this: document when you started a series or runs,
what you started, on which machines, and when the runs finished.
Write this information in some readme file, update it as runs finish,
and push to / pull from github to share the computations progress
with your team members.
If you use a separate or dedicated readme file for this information,
include a summary of it in your report summary.

You may be interested to predict how much computing time it
would take to analyze all 7 chromosomes,
based on extrapolating from your 30-block analysis.

## task 7
- Are the observed tree distances smaller than expected if  the 2 trees were chosen at random uniformly?  We would think so, if each plant was from a distinct population  and if populations did not mix.

- Do trees from consecutive blocks tend to be more similar to each other (at smaller distance) than trees from randomly chosen blocks   from the same chromosome?  We would expect so if blocks were small, due to less "recombination"  between neighboring blocks than between blocks at opposing ends of the chromosome.

  The observed tree distances are smaller than expected if the 2 trees were chosen at random uniformly.

This plot show that the distance of Randomly Chosen Blocks is larger than that of  Consecutive Blocks.
